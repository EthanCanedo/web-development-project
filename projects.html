            <p>Enhanced an automation process using Mainframe Terminal and REST API services to identify and retrieve discarded carpet rolls.
                 Implemented logic to reassign these rolls based on customer order factors such as color,
                  size, and style, ensuring efficient redistribution to fulfill new customer orders while minimizing waste.</p>

            <p>
                As part of my ongoing learning and to align with the technologies used in my current role at CNO Financial Group, 
                I’ve started developing a personal banking and insurance application using <strong>C#</strong>. 
                The goal is to simulate real-world features such as user authentication, account management, transaction tracking, 
                and basic insurance plan enrollment functionality.
            </p>

                This project helps reinforce my understanding of backend programming, form handling, and data structure design. 
                It also allows me to apply best practices in error handling, user experience, and modular development — all of which 
                are skills relevant to enterprise-level financial applications.
