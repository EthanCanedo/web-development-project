            <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio</h2>
            <h3>Current Role at CNO Financial Group</h3>
            <p>
              I recently began a full-time role as an RPA Analyst at <strong>CNO Financial Group</strong>, 
              a publicly traded financial services holding company headquartered in Carmel, Indiana. CNO provides insurance and retirement solutions 
              through its well-established brands: <strong>Bankers Life</strong>, <strong>Colonial Penn</strong>, and <strong>Washington National</strong>. 
              These subsidiaries serve middle-income Americans, with a focus on retirement readiness, supplemental health coverage, and income protection. 
              CNO plays a critical role in helping individuals and families manage financial planning and healthcare costs as they age, offering support 
              through both agent-based services and digital platforms.
            </p>
            <h3>Experience at Shaw Industries</h3>
            <p>
              Prior to CNO, I worked at <strong>Shaw Industries Group, Inc.</strong>, a global flooring manufacturer and subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, 
              headquartered in Dalton, Georgia. Shaw produces carpet, hardwood, vinyl, tile, and synthetic turf, serving both residential and commercial 
              markets worldwide. During my two years as an RPA Developer Co-op at Shaw, I implemented automation solutions using tools like 
              <strong>Automation Anywhere</strong>, <strong>Power Automate</strong>, REST APIs, and Python to streamline processes, reduce manual effort, 
              and enhance internal data accuracy across business units.
            </p>
            <h3>Continuing My Journey</h3>
            <p>
              My work at Shaw laid a strong technical foundation that Iâ€™ve continued to build upon at CNO, where I now support automation in a highly regulated 
              financial environment. I'm currently helping streamline internal operations and customer-facing workflows while also expanding my capabilities 
              with <strong>Pega Robotics</strong>. I'm passionate about combining technology and process improvement to make organizations more efficient and resilient.
